         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61163:4"/> that puts not away the evil of ſin from his fleſh, cannot long put away the evil of ſmart and ſuffering: whatever vain ſenſual men may imagine, the winding up will prove that of the Wiſe-man true, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.29. <hi>As righteouſneſs tendeth to life, ſo he that purſueth evil, purſueth it to his own death:</hi> and the Reaſon backing it is bottomed upon the ſame main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the <hi>flittingneſs, brevity,</hi> and <hi>uncertainty of Life,</hi> even in the young and luſty; <hi>for Childhood and Youth is vanity,</hi> i.e. are fading, paſſing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ſoon ſpent: Young men may bear and behave themſelves as if imagining their hot blood, luſty bodies, activity, beauty, would laſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and their youthful pleaſures never be at an end; but, <hi>Childhood and Youth are vanity:</hi> Death may not wait till they be gray-headed; or however, the earlieſt Morning haſtens apace to Noon, and then to Night.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inference or Duty exhorted to, you have in the words of the Text, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi> As in the former he was calling off from ſin, vanity, the empty purſuance of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo in this he is calling to, and putting upon the remembrance of the Creator, <hi>q.d.</hi> relinquiſh your vanities, and your ſenſual pleaſures and contentments, which will be bitterneſs in the latter end, and ſet your hearts ſeriouſly God-ward, turn your thoughts toward the minding him. And this Exhortation of young men to the <hi>now remembring of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is urged upon them by the ſame main Argument ſtill, The flittingneſs and vanity of Life, and the approaching certainty, and the evil and dark dayes of old Age and Death, <hi>While the evil dayes come not,</hi> &amp;c. as in this and the following Verſes; <hi>q.d.</hi> old Age and Death are haſtening upon you, and will certainly and ſoon overtake you. It is the former part of the Verſe, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> that I ſhall inſiſt upon, taking no further notice of the latter, but as it may be an Argument to enforce this. And here becauſe I ſtudy expedition, and the <hi>Explication</hi> will neceſſarily take up ſome room and time, as alſo that the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the duty here required of us, is couched in the expreſſions wherein it is commended to us, We ſhall firſt lay down the <hi>Concluſion</hi> or <hi>Point of Doctrine</hi> from the words, and then open it to you, and fetch the Reaſons out of its own bowels. The <hi>Obſervation</hi> then (according to the terms of the <hi>Text,</hi> which we ſhall after more fully unfold) is this:
<q>
                  <bibl>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </bibl> That it is every mans Duty, every young mans Duty, now in the dayes of his youth, to Remember his Creator. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is every mans duty to <hi>remember God,</hi> it is every young mans duty
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61163:4"/> to do it <hi>now</hi> in the dayes of his youth. For the clearing up of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and making way for the Application and Improvement of it, we have three things to handle and unfold: (1.) What this <hi>Remembring our Creator</hi> (he duty which the Text and Doctrine calls for) is importing. (2.) The Reaſons of our <hi>ſo doing,</hi> which the term of <hi>Creator</hi> is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. (3.) Why the Younger may not put it off, but it muſt be <hi>now done, now in the dayes of their youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. What this <hi>remembring God, remembring our Creator</hi> is importing. <hi>Remembring,</hi> commonly in Scripture acceptation, is not ſtrictly taken for the ſimple act of memory, the meer retaining a thing in our heads, nor is ſo here to be taken for any one ſimple act of the Soul, nor yet divers and continued acts of one and the ſame Faculty; but it is taken for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. It is the common ſaying of Divines, That words of knowledge of ſenſe in Scripture, imply affection and action, cogitation and practice, take in both the head and heart, include the whole Soul: by one word of <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, remembring,</hi> and the like, is included the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul, the whole man towards God. Such is the combination and concatenation of all the Faculties of the Soul, as of Links in a Chain, that draw one and draw all, break one and break all; upon this account any one act, or the act of any one ſingle Faculty, as <hi>knowing, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring,</hi> &amp;c. is uſually in Scripture put for the compleat, entire motion of the whole Soul. The term of <hi>our remembring God,</hi> ſo of <hi>his remembring us,</hi> is uſed ordinarily not ſtrictly, but in ſuch a latitude as we have been ſpeaking, if you conſult <hi>Neh.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.34. <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42. and a number of Texts more that might be named and recited (but I fear to be tedious) you will finde the ſenſe of the phraſe to run according to the breadth which we have been ſaying. In a word, we then <hi>remember God,</hi> not when we barely think of him, but when as ſuch we affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and practically acknowledge him, when we really own, and bear our ſelves toward him as our Creator; in ſum, when the whole entir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> motion of the whole Soul is Godward.</p>
            <p>Thus briefly and in general. But becauſe the burthen of the Duty of the Text hangs upon this word <hi>Remember,</hi> we ſhall yet a little further unfold it, and ſhew you yet ſomewhat more fully, diſtinctly, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, what the <hi>remembring God</hi> is implying and inferring, briefly.</p>

And as God is ſaid to <hi>remember us,</hi> when he doth according to what we would, when he hearkens to us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.22. <hi>And God remembred Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb:</hi> So we <hi>remember God,</hi> when we do according to what he would, when we hearken unto him.

            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, (not to multiply particulars) the <hi>remembring God,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends a thankful acknowledgement of, and aſcribing to him.

But ſo much what this <hi>Remembring God</hi> is importing.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing to be ſpoken to is, the <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Grounds</hi> of our ſo doing, which the very term of <hi>Creator</hi> is implying. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual in Scripture for men be ſpeaking God in Prayer and Thankſgiving, to preſent God under ſuch ſutable Notions, ſuch Titles and Attributes, as may moſt fitly ſet him forth as the Author and Beſtower of the deſired or obtained good, as you may ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 28.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 144.1, 2. ſo God ſpeak ng to us, and requiring duty from us, is clothed with ſuch Conſiderations, preſented under ſuch Notions and Titles as may carry with them the ground and reaſon of, and motive to the duty called for, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.22. and elſwhere. So here, there is Reaſon, Ground, Motive enough, in the Notion and Title of <hi>our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> that God is ſet forth by, to put us upon the duty required, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring of him: <hi>O come</hi> (ſay they, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95 6.) <hi>let us worſhip and bow down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> And this is their Motive, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.1, 2, 3. <hi>Make a joyful noiſe unto the Lord, all ye lands: ſerve the Lord with gladneſs, and come before his preſence with ſinging. Know ye that the Lord he is God, it is he that hath made us, and not we our ſelves; we are his people, and the ſheep of his paſture. At that day</hi> (ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.7) <hi>a man ſhall look, to his Maker, and his eyes ſhall have reſpect to the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> To whom ſhould the Creature have a reſpectful eye, whiche ſhould he look, but to his Maker? whom ſhould man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, but his Creator? But that we may more fully ſee this, we muſt know, that the term of <hi>Creator</hi> here uſed, ſets forth God as the Author of our Being out of nothing, ſo of all our Being and well bring, our bringing into Being, our continuance in Being, our preſervation, our well-being; all the adminiſtrations of God about us as to this, are wrapped up in his being ſet forth as our Creator; nor onely ſo, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the Right that he hath in us, the Regiment and Dominion that he hath over us, and the Diſpoſure that he hath of us, are here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61163:6"/> Theſe things conſidered, <hi>Why we ſhould Remember our Creator,</hi> is moſt evident, and the Reaſon runneth very ſtrong. But to touch ſome things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe God being our Creator, the Author and Fountain of our Being, is the End of our Being: the <hi>firſt Cauſe</hi> muſt needs be the <hi>laſt End;</hi> he that made all of himſelf, made all for himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. <hi>The Lord made all things for himſelf:</hi> Rom. 11.36. <hi>For of him, and through him, and to him are all things:</hi> Of whom, and through whom are all things, to him are all things; he that primarily made all things of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made all things ultimately for himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe God is not onely bringing us into, but continuing us in Being, preſerving, and adminiſtring to our well-being: we muſt all of us beſpeak God in <hi>Job</hi>'s language, <hi>Job</hi> 10.12. <hi>Thou haſt granted me life and favour, and thy viſitation hath preſerved my ſpirit,</hi> i.e. Being and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, and continuation of both: He is ſtyled, <hi>The preſerver of men,</hi> Job 7.20. <hi>He holdeth our ſoul in life,</hi> Pſal. 66.9. <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17.18. He maintaineth, and bloweth up the ſpark of his own kindling; <hi>He giveth to us life, and breath, and all things, ver.</hi> 25. of the ſame Chapter: It is from his careful Providence, that is continually exerciſed about us, that ſuch frail needy creatures are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſupplied, having a ſubſiſtence, and a comfortable one. God is not like the Carpenter or Maſon, that buildeth the Houſe, and then leaveth it to it ſelf, or the care of others, but he keepeth up what he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth up: we ſhould quickly loſe all, and ſink into our nothing again, did not the ſame hand that brought us out of nothing, keep us where we are. And to whom then do we owe our ſervice? whoſe are we? whom ſhould we remember? to whom ſhould we be, but his, to him, from whom we have our maintenance and preſervation, who is not our Maker onely, but our continual Upholder, and moſt bountiful Benefactor?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe God being our Creator, is our Proprietor, Poſſeſſor, Owner, Lord, Governour. As the Lord builds the houſe, and keepeth it in repair, ſo he holdeth it himſelf; as he built it for himſelf, ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth to be the Proprietor, Owner, Lord, Governour, Poſſeſſor of it; as he putteth not man out of his own hands in reſpect of preſervation, ſo neither in reſpect of poſſeſſion and dominion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. <hi>But now thus ſaith the Lord that created thee, O Jacob, and that formed thee, O Iſrael — thou art mine.</hi> To whom God ſaith, <hi>I have created, I have formed thee,</hi> he ſaith alſo, <hi>Thou art mine.</hi> It is moſt probable indeed that the Prophet here ſpeaks rather of ſpiritual then natural formation, of Gods making them in Grace then in Nature, but the reaſon holdeth the ſame and alike
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61163:7"/> good in both, God is ſaid to poſſeſs us upon a Creating account, his forming is phraſed his poſſeſſing of us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.13. <hi>Thou haſt poſſeſſed my reins, thou haſt covered me in my Mothers womb;</hi> ſo he poſſeſſeth us upon a Creation account: as he poſſeſſeth us in making, ſo he poſſeſſeth us having made us. God then challengeth us, and layeth claim to us in the moſt <hi>Abſolute Right,</hi> for it is beyond us to imagine, nor indeed can there be a more full and undoubted Right and Title, then Creation giveth; he being our Creator then, is in the moſt unqueſtionable Right our Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor, Proprietor, Lord, Owner, Diſpoſer, and we are his poſſeſſion, for his uſe, at his diſpoſe, bound thereunto in the higheſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Right — More might be added, from the <hi>knowledge</hi> God hath of us, as being our Maker, and intimately acquainted with us; <hi>He that made man, knoweth what is in man;</hi> he that <hi>formed the heart</hi> ſoundeth it, <hi>John</hi> 2.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.1, and the following Verſes: and from the <hi>power</hi> that he hath over us, being eaſily able to reach us, and puniſh us at pleaſure, for all our forgetfulneſs of him, and neglects of duty towards himſelf, the ſame hand that made can break us, he that built can eaſily pull us down, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5 7. <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">III. The third and laſt thing to be ſpoken to, for the clearing up of the Doctrine is, <hi>Why the youngeſt may not put it off, but they are now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Creator, now in the dayes of their youth.</hi> We ſhall fetch the Reaſons of this alſo out of the Text it ſelf, and they are (but to name them as it were)</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe as it is young mens <hi>now duty,</hi> Gods <hi>now due,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him, ſo God calleth for it <hi>now,</hi> it is Gods due from young men that they remember him <hi>now in the dayes of their youth,</hi> and God gives not day for payment, he requireth it out of hand of the Youngeſt. Look through the Scriptures and you will finde (I may not ſtay to inſtance in particular) all the commands of God reſpecting turning from ſin and vanity, and the neglect of him, and turning to, remembring, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of him, to lye upon you in the <hi>preſent tenſe,</hi> as what is to be now, inſtantly, preſently, and without delay attended.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As it is young mens <hi>now duty,</hi> Gods <hi>now due,</hi> that they remember him, and God now calleth for his due; ſo now is the fitteſt time of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is Gods <hi>now due,</hi> and God requireth it <hi>now,</hi> and ſuch may beſt do it, and diſcharge it <hi>now,</hi> in the dayes of youth; there is no ſuch ſeaſon as this <hi>now,</hi> theſe dayes of youth are affording; this reaſon you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the text, and proſecuted in the following verſes, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, while the evil dayes come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou ſhalt ſay, I have no pleaſure in them,</hi> &amp;c.

But of this we have next to ſpeak — Having thus ſet before you this ſin in <hi>the Evidence of it, what this ſin is,</hi> that the guilty may know they are guilty, I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſet it before you in <hi>the Aggravations of it, what a ſin it is, that the known guilty may know how guilty they are.</hi> Certainly forgetfulneſs of God, howſoever it may ſeem no great matter, and the commonneſs of it may cauſe men to be the leſs affected with it, hath more in it then ſlight inconſiderate ſpirits are aware of.

Thou art pleaſing and flattering thy ſelf, it may be, I am not as many other men, I live in no groſs ſin, I am no Adulterer, Fornicator, Drunkard,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61163:11"/> Thief, unjuſt dealer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alas man, is it a light thing, muſt it now go for no groſs ſin for the creature to forget his Creator, for man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own, diſacknowledge his Maker? doſt thou indeed think this is no great matter? and that ſeeing thou art no Adulterer, Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no groſs ſinner (as thou art pleaſed to call it) God may eaſily overlook and put it up that thou art forgetting, ſlighting, diſacknowledging, diſowning him all along. Bethink thy ſelf, man, is it indeed nothing or next to nothing, a ſmall matter with thee, to love and ſerve the creature more then the Creator, to remember too much every vanity, and forget the God that made thee? O that men were ſenſible, that they did but know how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and provoking a thing this is, and of how dangerous conſequence unto themſelves! We ſhall ſay ſomething (though we muſt be brief in either) both of the <hi>greatneſs,</hi> and of the <hi>danger</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The <hi>greatneſs of the ſin of forgetting God,</hi> may appear:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>the deep obligation that lyes upon you to remember him as he is your Creator.</hi> Look back upon what hath been ſaid before, and conſider what obligation Gods being your Maker layes upon you to remember him; you are wholly God's in all that you are and have from firſt to laſt; you are, and have nothing, but what you are and have from him and for him. To forget, diſacknowledge him therefore (being every way as deeply bound as is poſſible or imaginable) muſt needs be a great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a tranſcendent evil. O Sirs, do but ſeriouſly conſider how much you are indebted unto God for all things, and all along from your firſt Being untill this now, and ſure it will appear a ſtrange, horrible, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, unthankful, vile, inexcuſable thing, to forget and diſacknowledge h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m. O think, I beſeech you, how can it but be a ſin of the <hi>firſt Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> to forget, diſown God, who hath not onely done ſo much upon a <hi>Creation account,</hi> but is doing ſo much every day upon a <hi>Providential account,</hi> to make himſelf remembred by you? ſure there can be no room to think it a light thing to forget and diſacknowledge God, while his daily, hourly viſitations, and gracious remembrances of you, have any room in your thoughts: What, forget him <hi>that viſits you every morning, and mindes you every moment!</hi> We have the Pſalmiſt in a rapture of holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the ſon of man, that thou viſiteſt him?</hi> That God ſhould be mindful of man, ſo remember, viſit him, what a wonder is it? That man ſhould be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of God, forget, diſown him, what a wonder is it? That God ſhould be thoughtful of and about us, is a wonder of mercy and condeſcention; that we ſhould be thoughtleſs and unmindful of God, is a wonder of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and unthankfulneſs, for the friend to forget his friend, any
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61163:12"/> poor, indigent creature his moſt liberal Benefactor, for the Childe to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get and diſacknowledge his Father that begat him, the Mother that brought him forth, the Parents that nouriſhed and brought him up, is nothing to this, for the creature to forget his Maker. The bodies that you bear about you, all your bones, all the mercies you receive, all the creatures you enjoy and behold, are your daily remembrancers of God. O that you would think your lives are filled up with mercies, you are daily laden with benefits, and there is not one bleſſing which any of you have, but it hath from God this written upon it, <hi>Remember me.</hi> When God puts Bread into thy hands, he ſaith, <hi>Here, eat and remember me;</hi> when he fills thy Cup, he bids, <hi>Remember me;</hi> when he puts Clothes upon thy back, he ſaith, <hi>Remember me:</hi> God gives thee all, and he gives thee all to lead thee to himſelf, the remembrance and acknowledgement of himſelf. And, O man, is it nothing for all this to forget and diſown God, to whom thou art ſo obliged and indebted? That <hi>God</hi> that hath as it were ſtudied ſo many wayes to faſten himſelf in thy remembrance, canſt thou make a light matter of it, or how canſt thou look upon it otherwiſe then an intolerable inexcuſable evil, to ſin againſt ſuch merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> multiplied, and obliged remembrances of him? How canſt thou but ſay, <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> O how wilt thou ever be able to hold up thy head, that God that thus deeply and dearly deſerved to be remembred by thee, ſhall queſtion thee for thy forgetfulneſs of him? wilt thou then be able thinkeſt thou, to make as light a matter of it as thou now doſt, when he himſelf ſhall reaſon out the caſe with thee, when he ſhall ſay, <hi>Did I indeed make and maintain thee? did I houſe, and lodge, and feed, and clothe, and deliver thee? did I viſit thee every morning, and take care of thee every moment, and all to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get me?</hi> Sinner, God forgetting ſinner, can thy heart endure, or can thy hands be ſtrong in the day that God ſhall thus deal with thee? <hi>Now conſider this ye that forget God, leſt be tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. (I ſee I muſt but name things) This <hi>forgetting God</hi> muſt needs be no light ſin, nor a little provoking, having in it, carrying with it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing, and too evidently holding forth <hi>much contempt, a low and light eſteem of him.</hi> That which a man eſteems he keeps in memory, he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures it up there, is mindful, thoughtful of and about it: <hi>remembrance</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> run together, as you may ſee in that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137.5, 6. <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning; if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth:</hi> why, whence was this? you may ſee in the next words, <hi>If I prefer not

Pſal. 118 8.

Thinkeſt thou the time will never be (as little as thou careſt for, or ſtandeſt in need of God now) when thou ſhalt know thou ſtandeſt in as much need of God, as he doth of thee? thou ſtandeſt in as much need of his merciful remembrance, his beneficence, as he of thy dutiful remembrance and obedience.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61163:14"/> the abſence of God, his disfavour, that makes all but a meet heap of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and vexation, and ſuch as <hi>forget God</hi> (though the world ſmile upon them for the preſent) ſhall at laſt finde this ſo to their ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 17.10, 11. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt forgotten the God of thy ſalvation, and haſt not been mindful of the Rock of thy ſtrength, therefore ſhalt thou plant pleaſant plants, and ſhalt ſet it with ſtrange ſlips: In the day ſhalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning ſhalt thou make thy ſeed to flouriſh; but the harveſt ſhall be a heap in the day of grief, and of deſperate ſorrow.</hi> The plain meaning of it is, that howſoever thoſe that forget God purſue the world, may go ſmoothly on for a while, yet vexatious diſappointment will be the iſſue, a ruinous heap, irrepairable fruſtration, cauſing grief and deſperate ſorrow, ſhall be the harveſt which the flouriſhing ſeeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of all their cunning, careful, painful, pleaſing, promiſing projects ſhall afford them.

To thee young man it is ſpoken, and to thee young woman; to thee <hi>John,</hi> and to thee <hi>Thomas,</hi> to thee <hi>Mary,</hi> and to thee <hi>Sarah,</hi> the Exhortation as much, as particularly concerns thee, as if thy Name were written in the Text: and, Oh that I might be a poor Inſtrument in the hand of God, to bring home this word to thy heart! Oh that I might be thy effectual Remembrancer upon the account! Oh that I might perſwade, prevalently perſwade thee, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth to remember thy Creator!</hi> Oh that <hi>now</hi> man, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> while it is yet morning with thee, thou wouldeſt take time at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and improve this preſent, precious, peerleſs ſeaſon, which will be but for a little while, in the ſerious applying thy ſelf hereunto, and minding the God, and thy duty towards the God that made thee, <hi>now while the evil dayes come not.</hi> Remember and turn unto him <hi>now,</hi> ſet up, and acknowledge, and love, and fear, and ſerve him <hi>now:</hi> Do not think there is no ſuch haſte, if any man may put it off for a while I may, there can be no great danger or damage in deferring it a little: There is ſuch haſte, no man may put it off, no not a while, neither mayeſt thou, the danger, the damage of deferring but a little, a week, a day, may be thy eternal undoing. O do not think it is <hi>duty</hi> indeed to remember God, 'tis matter of <hi>importance,</hi> 'tis what muſt be done, I will do it, I will do it more, I will be more ſerious in it hereafter; but look upon it as thy <hi>now duty,</hi> as matter of importance and neceſſity to be done, and to be done to purpoſe, to be ſeriouſly dealt in <hi>now:</hi> truly <hi>hic labor,</hi> here is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; to perſwade men that it is duty to remember God, to convince men of the neceſſity of it, that it muſt be done, is not hard, but alas to prevail with men to do it <hi>now,</hi> inſtantly, preſently to attend it, here is the d fficulty and impoſſibility with the moſt men; and it is this, O it is this, the <hi>now remembring God,</hi> that I would fain perſwade thee to.

Queſtionleſs that is duty, that it is of neceſſity, and that it ſhall be done, they will finde a time for it, is with moſt men: Sure thou art ſaying in thy heart (thou that at preſent art moſt remiſs, negligent and forgetful of God) I will remember and turn unto the Lord ſometime or other before I die: thou art intending, purpoſing, promiſing thy ſelf, that though at preſent thou art too neglective, yet it ſhall not be alwayes thus, hereafter thou wilt be more ſerious, and if it be done at <hi>any time,</hi> it will be as well as if thou didſt it <hi>now.</hi> Haſt thou not ſome ſuch reaſonings of heart as theſe?

Sure thou judgeſt it requiſite, indiſpenſibly requiſite, to remember, turn to God, ſeek him, ſerve him, and that in good earneſt, thou canſt not but, know it is what muſt be done, or thou art for ever undone; And why may not what muſt be done be as well done, yea better done now then put off longer. O think ſeriouſly of it, if thou ever meaneſt to remember God, <hi>now</hi> is the time, <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth</hi> is the fitteſt, faireſt opportunity.

            <p n="1">1.

But this is ſo; for, (1.) Thy delaying, deferring, putting off, doth diſpoſe thee more and more ſtill to delay, defer, put off: the longer thou art putting off, the ſtronger will thy diſpoſition be to be putting off ſtill; the old Saying is full true here, <hi>Qui non vult hodie cras minus aptus erit,</hi> He that will not to day, ſhall be leſs fit to morrow; he that puts off now, will be more prone to put off hereafter; he that defers for the preſent, will do it much more for the future. Let me ask thee, (and I beſeech thee ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider of it) Doſt thou finde thy ſelf more diſpoſed to take the preſent time that now is, by all thy paſt puttings off? nay, doſt thou not finde that the more thou delayeſt and putteſt off, the more thou mayeſt, and that thou art ſo much the readier to do it ſtill, by how much the longer thou haſt done it already? and if this be the effect of <hi>former put offs</hi> as to the preſent, thou mayeſt eaſily gather what will be the fruit of <hi>preſent put offs</hi> as to the future. O believe it, every dayes procraſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, every weeks, and moneths, and years proroguing and putting off, ſets thee further off upon this account.

Do but ſeriouſly think of this, and ſure thou wilt ſee little reaſon to be delaying and putting off any longer; thou wilt ſee great reaſon to ſet thy ſelf to a preſent <hi>remembring thy Creator,</hi> to a now converting and turning unto God.

Oh! were this thought of, how rarely are ſuch wrought upon to remember God in their Age, who have been called upon (as thou now art) to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their Creator in the dayes of their youth;</hi> it is rarely, very rarely found, but men born and brought up under Means, are ſavingly wrought upon, converted and turned to God if ever, before they paſs the flower of their Age, and men brought under Means not long after they firſt enjoy them. The Word of God is wont early (if at all) to take indeed hold upon the Spirits of ſuch as are born and brought up under it, and it is ordinarily made quickly (if ever) an indeed convincing, converting, ſaving Word to them that are brought under it: for God effectually to convert, and call home to himſelf in elder years, ſuch as have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Means in their younger time, is more common, but to grow aged under Means, and then to be wrought upon, is a ſight ſeldome ſeen.

Many the ſad and dreadful Examples of men grown Sermon-proof, ſenſleſs, paſt feeling, upon whom the Word hath no power (unleſs to blinde and harden them further) that being often reproved, perſwaded, called upon, have ſtood out, put off, are before thee in the Bible upon record, and in preſent ſad Experience; there are many, very many that having turned a deaf ear to the Calls of God to <hi>Remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth,</hi> are ſtrangely infatuated, beſotted, hardened, rendred ſenſleſs and obdurate in their Age; but there are few, very few, very very few, if any, that neglecting the Calls of God to remember him in their youth, have attended it in their old Age.

Believe it man, if ever God give thee ſound Repentance, <hi>Repentance unto life,</hi> thou wilt finde ſin evil and bitter enough, thou needeſt not aggravate it, when thou indeed comeſt to make work for Repentance, thou wilt then know what it is to have made ſo much work of Repentance, when God ſhall ſet thy ſins, thy neglects of him, a courſe of forgetting, ſlighting, contemning him, that thou haſt long run on in, <hi>in order before thee,</hi> though it be in order to thy Humiliation, Repentance, Converſion, it may make thee wiſh again and again thou hadſt never ſtood out ſo long, and ſtored up ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for thy own ſoul.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hree things, I will but intimate them, though well worthy your ſerious conſideration. (1.) As we have been ſaying, Be ſure the more thou multiplieſt to ſin, the longer thou art going on in a courſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting God, the more thou art multiplying thy own ſorrows if God vouchſafe thee Repentance. (2.) Late Converſions are like Births in thoſe that are ancient, not without much difficulty, a hard travail, many throws, difficult deliverance: God ſaveth ſome, though more ſeldomly, that have longer put him off, but it is then <hi>ſo as by fire,</hi> as the Apoſtle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61163:20"/> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. or as it is <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 22.23. <hi>And of ſome have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, making a difference, and others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire:</hi> ſo God acts, ſuch a difference he makes, in ſeaſoning ſome with his grace in their young and tender years, and more eaſily work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng them to himſelf, whileſt others that run on are ſaved with fear, and pulled as brands out of the fire; many fears, heart-miſgiving, deſpairing thoughts ſuch are ordinarily attended with, God commonly makes thoſe that long put off, a <hi>Magar-miſſabib</hi> if ever he ſhew them mercy: ſuch are more ſeldome humbled, converted, ſaved, and when they are, it is not without much ado. (3) The ſins of youth, which ſuch have deeply run into, and long run on in, (though God do at laſt recover them by a ſound and ſoaking Repentance, and ſave them through much fear and terrour) remain many times a <hi>Corroſive</hi> gnawing upon their Spirits all their dayes, the ſting of ſuch and ſuch a ſweet ſin that they have been deeply in, ſticks with them to a dying day; it is made the hypocrites portion, to have <hi>his bones full of the ſins of his youth,</hi> Job 20.11. but it is many times the lot of ſuch whom God hath brought home to himſelf by a ſound Repentan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, to be <hi>made to poſſeſs the iniquities of their youth,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Jobs</hi> complaint, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. and <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25 7. Upon this account, by remembring and turning to God now, thou mayeſt haply prevent ſuch ſins, which ſhould God give thee here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after Repentance, may ſtick with thee to a dying day, and <hi>bring down</hi> (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>thy gray hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</hi> See then this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in a preſent early turning unto God, it will prevent many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, a great deal of ſad work. O therefore take the Wiſe-mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the laſt Verſe of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>Therefore remove ſorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy fleſh,</hi> do not put it upon thy ſelf, but take the courſe, the onely wiſe way to remedy and prevent it, which he preſcribes in the Text, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As hereby much ſin and ſorrow will be prevented, ſo hereby thou ſhalt abundantly provide for thy own good, comfort, benefit in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: if God take thee ſooner hence, it will be well thou art ready; if not, thou wilt abundantly reap in thy Age the benefit and advantage, the good and comfort of thy early remembring and turning to God. <hi>Youth or Spring</hi> (as one ſaith) <hi>is the Seed-time of grace and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To remember, turn to God betimes, to begin to be indeed good early, is the ready way to be good indeed, to be eminently good; a forward Spring and Seeds-time, is here the forerunner of a plentifull Harveſt; as he that begins betimes, and long continues to drive a gainfull trade, is long in taking in and treaſuring up, muſt needs be well ſtored and furniſhed, ſo it is with the early Chriſtian in his age, he is rich in grace, in ſpiritual experiences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thoſe ordinarily are moſt fat and flouriſhing, and bring forth moſt fruit in their age, that begin betimes. Oh think, how rich in knowledge, practicall ſaving knowledge, how ſtrong in faith, how intimately acquainted with God, how humble, holy and heavenly minded, how abounding in every grace, and rich in all manner of good works, mighteſt thou be, wouldſt thou be perſwaded <hi>now in the dayes of thy youth to remember thy Creator.</hi> O be indeed good, godly now, this is the way to be good indeed, eminently good and godly. (3.) The laſt advantage that I ſhall name as to this, that thou ſhalt have by an early turning unto God, is this, It will greaten thy reward in heaven; none ſhall ſerve God for nought, begin quickly, and hold on carefully and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thou ſhalt loſe nothing by it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. indeed <hi>the reward is not of work, it is of grace,</hi> but yet it is <hi>according to work,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.6. begin ever ſo ſoon, and follow it ever ſo diligently, and continue ever ſo long, thou ſhalt then receive a full reward for every moments ſervice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Hereby thy own good and comfort ſhall be as moſt abundantly, ſo moſt certainly provided for. Do it <hi>now,</hi> and then thou

Thy flouriſhing Youth, man, (O think of it) is fickle, flitting, frail, ſubject to Death as well as old Age, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.14. <hi>For what is your life? it is even a vapour:</hi> Man's life in general is ſo, the young man's life <hi>is even a vapour</hi> as well as the old man's, as we ſee in continual experience. Death's Motto is <hi>Nulli Caedo, I give place to, I ſpare none.</hi> We are like <hi>Venice</hi>-glaſſes; not thoſe that are firſt made are firſt broke, but thoſe that are firſt knockt. Death is often ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected in its approaches; the <hi>evil day</hi> is very nigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when men are putting it furtheſt off: The fool in the Goſpel-Parable leſſons us, how prone we are to caſt up our Accounts for <hi>many years,</hi> when it may be we have not <hi>one night to live.</hi> The notion of Death is too apt to look to all men, eſpecially to young men, like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.27. <hi>The Viſion that he ſeeth it for many dayes,</hi> and he prophecieth of times that are afar off. Young men look it may be on the gray-headed as well on their way to the Grave, and haply think it is time for old men to think of dying, but from themſelves they put it at a great diſtance; but moſt true it is, that <hi>Senibus Mors in januis adoleſcentibus in inſidiis,</hi> Death is oftentimes as near the young mans back as it is the old mans face, even while he ſaith of Death, (as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Servant in the Goſpel of his Lord) <hi>He delayeth his coming, it cometh in a day when he looketh not for it, and in an hour when he is not aware of,</hi> and calleth him off, and ſendeth him (unprepared as he is) <hi>to the Land of Darkneſs,</hi> whence there is no redemption. O think man, hath not death ſurprized many a poor unprovided ſinner, that <hi>put the evil day far off</hi> as confidently, and upon as good grounds as thy ſelf?

            <p>I have ſaid what I ſhall ſay upon this Text, beſeeching you that it may be thought upon, and beſeeching God to give his bleſſing: But I have another Subject, that I muſt crave a few minutes time, and a grain or two of patience more, to ſay ſomething of; and that is <hi>the Young man lately deceaſed,</hi> at whoſe <hi>Requeſt,</hi> and as whoſe <hi>Bequeſt,</hi> you have had this Sermon; and it is not the <hi>Commendation of the dead</hi> that is the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he needs it not, but the <hi>Inſtruction of the living.</hi> As his Death in the time and manner of it was a real Sermon upon the Text, of which we have been ſpeaking, ſo (in other reſpect) was his Life alſo in ſome good degree: and I have two ſayings (to young men eſpecially upon this Subject) 1. In ſome things obſervable in him as to his Life, he was <hi>a Patern for your Imitation.</hi> 2. In ſome things obſervable about him as to his Death, he was <hi>an Example for your Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, In ſome things obſervable in him as to his Life, he was <hi>a Patern for your Imitation:</hi> but to intimate ſome few things of ſpecial remark.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was a young man of an <hi>innocent Converſation,</hi> of a <hi>civil, ſober Behaviour;</hi> he was not of a debauched diſſolute life, nor did he <hi>run with others to that exceſs of riot</hi> which (with ſad hearts) we ſee many young men do; his Converſation was not ſpotted with ſuch marks of deboiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as are too viſible upon too many of his Age. Now though Civility, Sobriety, Morality, are not Grace, yet they are <hi>Jewels of price,</hi> that have an amiableneſs and lovelineſs both in the eyes of God and good men: it is ſaid of the young man in the Goſpel-ſtory (in <hi>Mark</hi> 10.21.) that when Chriſt had heard from him what he had done, how he had lived, that he was a civil, ſober, moral man (though evident it is by the ſtory that he was a ſtranger to <hi>the power of godlineſs</hi>) that <hi>Jeſus beholding him, loved him.</hi> Not but that <hi>I am perſwaded better things of the young m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Alas, a young man of <hi>a ſerious Spirit,</hi> that is of ſome <hi>weight and worth,</hi> that is ſomething beſides meer froth and vanity, that mindes ſomething worthy a man, is too rare a ſight amongſt us. Oh the exceeding vanity of the younger ſort! (and too many of the elder too) Alas, what a meer <hi>Bubble of Vanity,</hi> wrapped up in a bundle of fine Clothes, is many a young Man, many a Maid? their clothing may be coſtly, but their hearts, their mindes (as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20) <hi>are little worth.</hi> O how empty are they of all that is of worth, that good is, but running over with meer vanity, <hi>and ſuperfluity of naughtineſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. Mens mindes and mouthes run over with very froth and vanity, ſcarce a ſerious thought in the one, or a ſober ſavoury word in the other; not a Bible or a good Book in hand the week long it may be: you had a better Example in him then this comes to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This young man (as is credibly teſtified of him) was <hi>a dutifull Childe to his Parents;</hi> he was inured to bear the yoke from his youth: He could almoſt ſay, as the Son in the Parable to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.29. <hi>Neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy commandment.</hi> Never but once (as himſelf was ſaying to an intimate Friend of his not long before his death) was he unſeaſonably abſent from his Fathers Family in all his life. Young men, I am afraid it is not once, nor twice, nor thrice, nor ten times, that will excuſe ſome of you. 'Tis the complaint of Parents, of Maſters, (and a ſad complaint it is) that they cannot keep their Children, their Servants in, but that they will be out at all hours; and if you obſerv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, the bottom-Argument is, <hi>Others do ſo, and they muſt and will.</hi> O that you would be perſwaded to follow his better Example.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:61163:23"/>4. To adde no more: He was a young man that <hi>ſeemed to ſavour of, and affect the beſt things.</hi> What is ſaid of young <hi>Abijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.13. appeared very hopeful concerning him, that <hi>in him there was found ſome good thing toward the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> I do not doubt but that it may be truly ſaid of him, That he had more Sermons by him of his own hand-writing, not onely then the moſt of the young men in <hi>Fair-field,</hi> but then moſt of his Age have. His writing Sermons at Meeting was commendable and imitable, as alſo the after-improvement that he made of them; his Notes were not laid by as uſeleſs, or ſerved to put under Pies, but they were overlook'd and repeated by himſelf, and to others as occaſion offered. The Sermons that he took here the laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (as I am informed) have been ſince called over in his Fathers Family. That he was ready and forward upon ſuch accounts, is the account that ſuch give of him that beſt knew him; and as to this, there is one thing more that would not be omitted, That when he came now lately out of the <hi>Bay,</hi> a little before his laſt Sickneſs, that being at Sea upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſeeing the Morning well ſpent, and nothing going forward of a Sabbath dayes work, he began to minde them (though the youngeſt of the Company) of the Day, and Duty thereunto belonging, deſiring they might go to Prayer, and he would repeat a Sermon to them, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he did both Forenoon and Afternoon. Young men, let I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you his Example upon theſe accounts Provoke your Imitation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As in theſe things obſervable in him as to his <hi>Life,</hi> he was <hi>a Patern for your Imitation;</hi> ſo in ſome things obſervable about him as to his <hi>Death,</hi> he was <hi>an Example for your Admonition.</hi> Very briefly but to touch upon two or three things, leſt I utterly tire you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Time of his Death,</hi> being in <hi>the flower of his Age,</hi> little more then Eighteen, is <hi>for your Admonition,</hi> to <hi>Remember now your Creator in the dayes of your youth,</hi> who are now in your bloſſ me: he was not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the ſtrength of his Age, he was but newly come as it were to years of diſcretion; Art thou paſt a Childe? doſt thou begin to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thy ſelf? it is dangerous for thee to put off God, the <hi>remembring thy Creator</hi> not for a longer, but for any time: Art thou Fifteen, Sixt en, Eighteen years old? it is too great an adventure to put it off till thou art Twenty, or One and twenty. Thou art young, and ſtrong, and luſty, and thinkeſt thou mayeſt more boldly adventure, meaſuring thy Life by thy Age and Conſtitution; but are theſe certain Evidences as to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thy Soul upon? are theſe ſuch infallible Probabilities as to run the hazard of thy hopes for Heaven upon? The Example that is before thee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61163:23"/> in this young man (whom Death ſcarce ſuffered to be called a man) may convince thee of the contrary. O who would not be alwayes ready, when his Summons are ſo exceeding uncertain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Manner of his Sickneſs</hi> is Admonitory alſo, and may leſſon you this, That <hi>it is good doing your great Work before the evil dayes of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs come.</hi> Alas, there is little time, room, opportunity or ability then, A pained Body, a diſtempered Brain, a diſturbed Spirit, diſability of Speech, neceſſary Reſt, and theſe and thoſe Attendances, incapacitate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, take up the time, and leave men commonly but a ſorry opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of doing any thing to purpoſe for their Souls. I was with him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times in his Sickneſs, yet had opportunity but once to ſay any thing to purpoſe to him; one while flumbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing, another while diſtempered in his Head, or buſily taken up by his bodily neceſſities and attendances. O man, Death may ſnatch thee away ſuddenly, it doth not give every one a wee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or ten dayes warning; but if not, a leiſurely Sickneſs may afford thee little leiſure for thy Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How it was with him in his <hi>Sickneſs</hi> too, how his Spirit wrought, may admoniſh you <hi>to make thorow work of your great Work.</hi> It was diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to him to ſpeak from an obſtruction in his Throat, and ſomewhat difficult to underſtand him when he did ſpeak, and ſo the leſs can be ſaid; but ſo much in ſubſtance might be gathered from him, That he looked upon himſelf an undone man without an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; yet he was not without ſome hope that he was at peace with God in him, yet not without fears, bemoaning himſelf in reſpect of his hardneſs of heart and blindneſs of minde, and that he had been no more throughly wrought upon by the Means that he had formerly enjoyed. O Sirs, Dying times are Trying times; to die cauſleſly confidently I am afraid is too common, but to die groundedly comfortably is a great work. O do, do throughly what thou haſt to do, man, when Death comes thou wilt not finde it is too well done.</p>
